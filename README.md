<h1>Valley View Conference Center WebSite</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a dynamic, multi-page website for the Valley View Conference Center, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows businesses and organizations to register for events, plan breakout sessions, and design custom announcements. JavaScript is used extensively to handle form data, validate input, reveal hidden elements, and generate real-time summaries. Object-oriented programming is implemented to manage breakout session entries, and event-driven scripting enables interactive previews and styling for announcements. The project demonstrates practical skills in DOM manipulation, form processing, and user interface design, and serves as a complete front-end solution for event registration and planning.
