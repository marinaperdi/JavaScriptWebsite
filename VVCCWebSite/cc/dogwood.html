        The Dogwood Room is a small conference room that will accomodate up to
        25 seats with a conference table. It can be used as a meeting room, or
        it can be configured as a small classroom with desk-style tables and
        chairs. The Dogwood Room has it's own HVAC system controlled from the
        podium or from the master room control just inside the door.
